to income-model
    ;This model is used to simulate the fluctuations in wages
  ;Step 1: generate a set of income according to the average income this year
  ;Step 2: Distribute these salaries to employees according to certain rules (e.g., 20% of people receive salary increases, 20% receive salary reductions, and 60% remain basically unchanged)
